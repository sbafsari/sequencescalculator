# sequencescalculator
This is my the first python code. I wrote calculator for to calculate for finding terms or sums of sequences. There can be mistakes, sorry for these :)

About the Calculator

Firstly, the calculator always works until you type wrong number while you are deciding your values or equations. When the calculator starts, you type your the first two values of sequence. After that you type a term number which the problem asked to you for to find. Finally you type your choice for finding term or sum of sequence. Also you can find sum of infinite sequence. That's all :)
